###  Billy Kidding is an aspiring children's book author. He holds a BA in Linguistics from Brigham Young University and is a cybersecurity practitioner by day.

###  Billy grew up in Auburn, California. His parents divorced when he was very young. He experienced being the oldest child, the youngest child, and the only child, due to custodial arrangements changing throughout his life. At age 19, he served a two-year mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in South Korea. He then moved to Utah to attend BYU, where he met and married the love of his life.

###  Billy has too many children to have hobbies, but he does love reading to his kids.
